## Describe your professional experience/research: 
My major contribution to my PhD dissertation experiment with a strong emphasis on high precision was to develop an effective approach to prompt detection of unwanted noises and their interference with actual signals. The appearance of noises arose from hardware (e.g. beam position/energy monitors) failures, software defects or both. Noises biased measured physics quantities, leading to unavoidable errors made to data. I created multivariate regression models expanded with different dimensions in order to account for systematic effects and to further gain more understandings of noise sources. Various beam-related noises were characterized with associated self-defined parameters for prompt detection of faulty systems. Through controlling and monitoring a set of mutually diagonal variables used to parameterize multivariate regression models, experimentalists better know how to optimize detector performances by minimizing noise sizes. My thesis paper was published in 2012 (w/**489** [cites](http://https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y1_oidsAAAAJ&hl=en) to-date).

## List programming languages and software: 
MATLAB: 2 years of brain image data processing, calibration and analysis with state-of-the-art machine learning technical approaches. C/C++: over 10 years of scientific programming projects for Monte Carlo simulations of particle physics detector design and algorithms of detector calibration. PYTHON: a few years (~5 years) of experiences in multidisciplinary fields of research, e.g. particle physics, neuroscience and psychology.

## Describe your side projects: 
I conducted brain functional neuro-image analysis. Despite having no experiences in neuroscience, economics and business management, I was able to overcome deficiencies and deliver image analysis software, used to better interpret subjects' responses to a wide range of external stimulation, so that fundamental understandings of correlations among variables become vivid. Furthermore, behavioral responses are subject to a list of factors such as genders, ages, personalities, education levels, job titles, intelligence quotient, emotion quotient, left-right handedness and so on. I implemented a great variety of behavioral scenarios into separate multivariate regression models for cross-comparison and cross-fitting, process and analyze huge time-series 3D image data to extract out dependencies among different behavioral responses and decision-making outcomes in one given model. Depending on cross-fitting results, the model manifesting most new insights is selective for journal publications.

## What excites you about data science? 
As a [physicist](http://https://academictree.org/physics/peopleinfo.php?pid=434403, https://inspirehep.net/authors/1042285), I love finding patterns from observations. with patterns, I love figuring out what resulted in different patterns, in addition to discovering any other possible, unseen patterns generated by unknown sources. besides brain image data analysis, I, as a particle physics detector physicist, also would like to put emphases on object detection projects for medical device R&D. I received interview for the position of X-ray CT detector scientist at Canon (at Vermont IL). Despite hardware R&D, I still need to work on detector calibration algorithm for the detector design. If I am able to analyze my detector's image data with my own hobby - CNN as one of the famous deep learning models, I will provide more new insights knowing how to improve the detector's performance in order to have my designed detector meet the actual need of customers, e.g. hospitals. I love both hardware design and software development. learning how to interpret data motivates me to produce better devices
