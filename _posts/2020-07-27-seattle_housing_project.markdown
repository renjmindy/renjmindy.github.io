I would like to utilize this data to study home buyers' decision-making behaviors, e.g. customer purchase behavior modeling. 

To begin with, we ask one question prior to data exploration: What're major factors that may make impact on house buyers' behaviors? We list them as follows:

1. house location

*  weather factor

*  daily commute time, road condition and traffic safety

*  neighborhood quality, e.g. ethics, religion, immigration backgrounds, political parties, education level, salary range, career/occupation and ages

*  school district for kid education

*  community life, convenience and entertainment, e.g. close to church, hospital, gym, national state park, fishing area, dairy food farms and so on

*  cime rate

2. house age

*  when it was built

*  has it ever been renovated?

*  house grade based on the King County grading scale system 

3. house size

*  interior 

*  ratio of interior to overall (exterior included)

*  family size

4. house design

*  floor plan

*  with or without basement?

5. house amenities

* pool nearby?

6. house price

*  home buyer's economic capability

*  home buyer's health condition

*  buyer's age range or generation

*  buyer's intension to be a landlord of the house (monthly rental fee)

*  annual tax payment

*  renovation/maintenance expanses included?

*  loan option for specific groups

*  discount deal/offer for specific groups and seasons
